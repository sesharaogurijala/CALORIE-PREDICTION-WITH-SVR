# Calories Prediction Project 🥗⚙️

This project uses *Support Vector Regression (SVR)* to predict calories burned based on physical activity data. It demonstrates a complete machine learning workflow — from data preprocessing to model evaluation — using Python and popular data science libraries.

## 🚀 Project Overview

The objective of this project is to build a predictive model that estimates the number of calories burned based on physical parameters like duration, heart rate, body metrics, and more.  
It leverages *Support Vector Machine (SVM)* regression technique for better performance on non-linear data.

## 📂 Project Structure

- *Data Processing:* Cleaning and preparing the data.
- *Exploratory Data Analysis:* Understanding patterns and correlations.
- *Feature Scaling & Encoding:* Using StandardScaler & OneHotEncoder.
- *Model Training:* Building an SVR model with hyperparameter tuning (GridSearchCV).
- *Evaluation:* Metrics used include *R² Score, **MAE, and **RMSE*.
- *Visualization:* Performance plots and analysis.
